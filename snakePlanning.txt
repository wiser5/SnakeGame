Snake Planning
Game:

GUI Planning
Snake Game should be at the top of each display
add my name very small at the bottom?

home screen: display high scores, button to play, button to display directions, button to quit program (also have red exit button close)

directions: list of directions, button to return to home screen

game: countdown to start, score to beat (minimum score to get on leaderboard), matrix, button stating key bindings, buttons to press to move, button to quit and return to main screen

matrix from game: make every space a box; open space green, snake blue, snake head red

post game screen: button to go to enter username for leaderboard if applicable, button to return to home

screen to get name for leaderboard if applicable: label explaining screen, way to get input by typing (probably JTextArea)

things to possibly add later
ability to change key bindings
